# bip_dev
Development on amazfit bip calendar with events. 


To compile the calendar app and patch the resource file, just doble click compile_and_patch.bat
You may want to modify the compile_and_patch.bat to load your own .res file, since the one that is being loaded is a very light .res file for debugging purposes only.
If you need help getting started, I would gladly help.
